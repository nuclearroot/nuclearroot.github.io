# My OSCP experience

I wanted to take OSCP to challenge myself and learn something new that has always interested me. When I began I didn't really know where to start, so hopefully this blog post will give people thinking of taking the exam some insight.

## My prior experience

I have worked in InfoSec for around 3 years, most recently I have been working as a SOC Analyst, in the worst case scenrio, defending against the sort of attacks one might learn in their OSCP studies. I felt like doing OSCP would better help me notice malicious behavior, which in some ways it did. 

I held the CompTIA Network+, Security+ and CySA+ certifications prior to taking the OSCP. It would be fair to say I had a general idea of some of the attacks, but no clue how to perform one. Even the concepts of reverse shells were beyond me when I began. My linux experience wasn't too great, I could cd around directories and list files, but that was probably about it. 

## What did I use to study? 

I will go into some more detail about these resources after, but I used Virtual Hacking Labs, Hack the Box, TryHackMe, Wizard Labs, PWK, Ippsec Videos and Tib3rius' privelege escalation courses.

### Virtual Hacking Labs

Virtual Hacking Labs was my intial exposure into the world of hacking. I bought the 3 month package, which comes with the 3 months in the labs and a courseware PDF. The courseware was very easy for me to follow and understand, it really holds your hand to make sure you understand what it is trying to teach. The machines in the labs have 3 ranks, Beginner, Advanced and Advanced+, so you can start easy and work your way up. There are slight nudges for the machines in the control panel, except for the Advanced+ where you are left on your own to try figure them out. I think the privilege escalation part of the course and labs could use some more variety, however I still think this is a great resource and part of the reason I passed.
