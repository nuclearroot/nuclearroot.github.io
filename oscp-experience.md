# My OSCP experience

I wanted to take OSCP to challenge myself and learn something new that has always interested me. When I began I didn't really know where to start, so hopefully this blog post will give people thinking of taking the exam some insight.

## My prior experience

I have worked in InfoSec for around 3 years, most recently I have been working as a SOC Analyst, in the worst case scenrio, defending against the sort of attacks one might learn in their OSCP studies. I felt like doing OSCP would better help me notice malicious behavior, which in some ways it did. 

I held the CompTIA Network+, Security+ and CySA+ certifications prior to taking the OSCP. It would be fair to say I had a general idea of some of the attacks, but no clue how to perform one. Even the concepts of reverse shells were beyond me when I began. My linux experience wasn't too great, I could cd around directories and list files, but that was probably about it. 

## What did I use to study? 

I will go into some more detail about these resources after, but I used Virtual Hacking Labs, Hack the Box, TryHackMe, Wizard Labs, Ippsec Videos, Tib3rius' privelege escalation courses.
