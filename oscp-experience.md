# My OSCP experience

I wanted to take OSCP to challenge myself and learn something new that has always interested me. When I began I didn't really know where to start, so hopefully this blog post will give people thinking of taking the exam some insight.

## My prior experience

I have worked in InfoSec for around 3 years, most recently I have been working as a SOC Analyst, in the worst case scenrio, defending against the sort of attacks one might learn in their OSCP studies. I felt like doing OSCP would better help me notice malicious behavior, which in some ways it did. 

I held the CompTIA Network+, Security+ and CySA+ certifications prior to taking the OSCP. It would be fair to say I had a general idea of some of the attacks, but no clue how to perform one. Even the concepts of reverse shells were beyond me when I began. My linux experience wasn't too great, I could cd around directories and list files, but that was probably about it. 

## What did I use to study? 

I will go into some more detail about these resources after, but I used Virtual Hacking Labs, Hack the Box, TryHackMe, Wizard Labs, PWK, Ippsec Videos and Tib3rius' privelege escalation courses.

### Virtual Hacking Labs

Virtual Hacking Labs was my intial exposure into the world of hacking. I bought the 3 month package, which comes with the 3 months in the labs and a courseware PDF. The courseware was very easy for me to follow and understand, it really holds your hand to make sure you understand what it is trying to teach. The machines in the labs have 3 ranks, Beginner, Advanced and Advanced+, so you can start easy and work your way up. There are slight nudges for the machines in the control panel, except for the Advanced+ where you are left on your own to try figure them out. I think the privilege escalation part of the course and labs could use some more variety, however I still think this is a great resource and part of the reason I passed.

### Hack The Box

I'm sure the vast majority have already heard of Hack The Box. It's a great site with many different boxes, ranging from Easy to Insane. Some of these boxes can be very CTFy and most are probably out of scope for the OSCP exam. There is a list compiled by TJ Null, which goes through some OSCP like boxes, I would suggest 90% of these be completed before attempting the exam. Hack The Box is arguably the best when it comes to priv esc as there is lots of variety. To do the boxes on the list you will have to buy HTB VIP, which is around Â£10 a month.

### Ippsec Videos

I think this is one of the most crucial things you can do, watch IppSec's videos in your free time, even boxes that would be considered too hard for OSCP. You could learn something from a harder box and apply it during your exam. You'll also be able see how he enumerates each port/service and add that to your methodology. I would suggest first attempting the boxes before watching the IppSec tutorials, especially for the more OSCP-esque boxes. Best of all it's free!
